# UFOs

## Overview of Project
We were tasked with helping Dana provide a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. To accomplish this we utlized more filters for different criteria at the same time. Users of Dana's website can now narrow down thier search by filtering multiple items at once.

## Results
All relevant files to viewing the webpage can be downloaded from this link in GitHub.

[UFOs](https://github.com/akinsolasalami/UFOs).

Once all files have been downloaded, you can open the index.html file in your default browser.

Once opened the webpage should look like this

![UFO Webpage](images/image1.png "Loaded Webpage")

On the left side you will find the input boxes for the filters. Visitors of the webpage enter different texts that match the examples shown and the table will be updated. 

For example, if a visitor would like to search for just UFO sighting cases in Florida, all the would have to do is input 'fl' in the state filter. example shown below

![FL filter](images/image2.png "Search Criteria One")

Additionally, if the same user would like to know only which sightings where shperical in shape they could enter 'sphere' into the shape input. example shown below

![FL filter](images/image3.png "Search Criteria Tne")

As you can see, the table on the right continues to be updated as more search criteria is put in. 

If the user would like to refresh their search. They can just remove their input from the filters and the table will show all the entries.


## Summary
1. I think the webpage could use more interactivity, this would make it more interesting to visitors on our website.

1. I think also it would be important to let users know what options they have available. For examples in the shape column, we should be able to let them know. Only these options are available. 

1. I think it would also help to expand our dataset beyond the US.
